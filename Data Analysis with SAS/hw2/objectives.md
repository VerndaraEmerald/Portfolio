Ex 1 is working with data and time formats.

Ex 2 involves using SAS titles, footnotes, sorting, and variable selection in PROC PRINT. The ALT form uses PROC IMPORT instead.

Ex 3 is a PROC REPORT that renames several variables and sets certain spacing. It is meant to be viewed in the SAS Log rather than results.
