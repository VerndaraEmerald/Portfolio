### Brief

## 01
All categorical variables were summarized with bar charts, relative frequency charts, tables, and pie charts. After that, all quantitative variables had their correlations measured via a correlation matrix, and from there, the most significant correlations were graphed. There are also a few experimental graphs that used facet wraps to display health-categorized BMI amounts.
