# Brief
Cherissame amis. This portfolio compiles all of my assignments and personal projects demonstrative of my technical skills. For quick checking, I have placed representative files in this front page, described below. For deeper checking, each category contains every assignment/project. Categories include:

* Applied Regression Analysis: Fall 2023 with Dr. Olga Korosteleva at CSULB. Uses R, Python, and SAS.
* Data Analysis with SAS: Fall 2023 with Dr. Olga Korosteleva at CSULB.
* Introduction to R: Fall 2023 with Dr. Hojin Moon at CSULB.
* Admissions dataset: A personal project using CSULB Admissions data. Uses SAS and SQL.

## Note
Do not open SAS directly. Click directly on/directly open program files. This ensures that the root directory is set to the program file, not users.

# TO DO
Rework SASNB files into regular SAS files to allow for relative references.
