# Brief
Cherissame amis. This portfolio compiles all of my assignments and personal projects demonstrative of my technical skills. For quick checking, I have placed representative files in this front page, described below. For deeper checking, each category contains every assignment/project. Categories include:

* Applied Regression Analysis: Fall 2023 with Dr. Olga Korosteleva at CSULB. Uses R, Python, and SAS.
* Data Analysis with SAS: Fall 2023 with Dr. Olga Korosteleva at CSULB.
* Introduction to R: Fall 2023 with Dr. Hojin Moon at CSULB.
* Admissions dataset: A personal project using CSULB Admissions data. Uses SAS and SQL.

# Representative files
There are four total representative files:
* Applied Regression Analysis: A Python program that automatically writes most of a SAS program, as well as a Python regression model. While simple, note that this Python regression model is also being sent back to Dr. Olga as a supplement to her book. This is representative of my non-specific concerns of education, as her Applied Regression Analysis course has yet to include extensive Python. A more detailed introductory Python guide is found in the Applied Regression Analysis folder.
* Data Analysis with SAS: A data organization that uses arrays and proc formats to organize a data set. 
* Introduction to R: An example of data visualization using GGPlot.
* Admissions dataset: An example of a SQL select.
